Nay, not without wound in the\\nspirit shall I leave this city. {8}Long\\nwere days of pain I have spent\\nwithin its walls, long were the\\nnights of aloneness; who can depart\\nfrom his pain his aloneness without\\nregret?\\n\\nToo many fragments of spirit have I\\nscattered in these streets, too many\\nare children of my longing that walk\\nnaked among these hills, I cannot\\nwithdraw from them without burden and\\nan ache.\\n\\nIt is not garment I cast off this\\nday, but skin that I tear with my own\\nhands.\\n\\nNor is it thought I leave behind me,\\nbut heart made sweet with hunger and\\nwith thirst.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nYet I cannot tarry longer.\\n\\nThe sea that calls all things unto her\\ncalls me, I must embark.\\n\\nFor to stay, though hours burn in\\nthe night, is to freeze crystallize\\nand be bound in mould.\\n\\nFain would I take with me all that is\\nhere. But how shall I?\\n\\nA voice cannot carry tongue and\\n{9}the lips that gave it wings. Alone\\nmust it seek ether.\\n\\nAnd alone without his nest shall the\\neagle fly across sun.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nNow when he reached foot of the\\nhill, he turned again towards sea,\\nand he saw his ship approaching the\\nharbour, upon her prow mariners,\\nthe men of his own land.\\n\\nAnd his soul cried out to them, he\\nsaid:\\n\\nSons of my ancient mother, you riders of\\nthe tides,\\n\\nHow often have you sailed in my dreams.\\nAnd now you come in my awakening, which\\nis my deeper dream.\\n\\nReady am I to go, my eagerness with\\nsails full set awaits wind.\\n\\nOnly another breath will I breathe in\\nthis still air, only another loving look\\ncast backward,\\n\\nAnd then I shall stand among you, a\\nseafarer among seafarers. {10}And you,\\nvast sea, sleepless mother,\\n\\nWho alone are peace freedom to the\\nriver stream,\\n\\nOnly another winding will this stream\\nmake, only another murmur in this glade,\\n\\nAnd then shall I come to you, a\\nboundless drop to boundless ocean.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd as he walked he saw from afar men\\nand women leaving their fields their\\nvineyards hastening towards city\\ngates.\\n\\nAnd he heard their voices calling his\\nname, shouting from field to field\\ntelling one another of coming of his\\nship.\\n\\nAnd he said to himself:\\n\\nShall day of parting be day of\\ngathering?\\n\\nAnd shall it be said that my eve was in\\ntruth my dawn?\\n\\nAnd what shall I give unto him who has\\nleft his plough in midfurrow, or to\\nhim who has stopped wheel of his\\nwinepress? {11}Shall my heart become a\\ntree heavy-laden with fruit that I may\\ngather give unto them?\\n\\nAnd shall my desires flow like a\\nfountain that I may fill their cups?\\n\\nAm I harp that hand of mighty\\nmay touch me, or flute that his breath\\nmay pass through me?\\n\\nA seeker of silences am I, what\\ntreasure have I found in silences that I\\nmay dispense with confidence?\\n\\nIf this is my day of harvest, in what\\nfields have I sowed seed, in\\nwhat unremembered seasons?\\n\\nIf this indeed be hour in which I\\nlift up my lantern, it is not my flame\\nthat shall burn therein.\\n\\nEmpty dark shall I raise my lantern,\\n\\nAnd guardian of night shall fill\\nit with oil he shall light it also.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nThese things he said in words. But much\\nin his heart remained unsaid. For {12}he\\nhimself could not speak his deeper\\nsecret.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n[Illustration: 0020]\\n\\nAnd when he entered into city all\\nthe people came to meet him, they\\nwere crying out to him as with one\\nvoice.\\n\\nAnd elders of city stood forth\\nand said:\\n\\nGo not yet away from us.\\n\\nA noontide have you been in our\\ntwilight, your youth has given us\\ndreams to dream.\\n\\nNo stranger are you among us, nor\\na guest, but our son our dearly\\nbeloved.\\n\\nSuffer not yet our eyes to hunger for\\nyour face.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd priests priestesses said\\nunto him:\\n\\nLet not waves of sea separate us\\nnow, years you have spent in our\\nmidst become memory.\\n\\nYou have walked among us spirit,\\n{13}and your shadow has been light\\nupon our faces.\\n\\nMuch have we loved you. But speechless\\nwas our love, with veils has it been\\nveiled.\\n\\nYet now it cries aloud unto you, and\\nwould stand revealed before you.\\n\\nAnd ever has it been that love knows\\nnot its own depth until hour of\\nseparation.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd others came also entreated him.\\nBut he answered them not. He only bent\\nhis head; those who stood near saw\\nhis tears falling upon his breast.\\n\\nAnd he people proceeded towards\\nthe great square before temple.\\n\\nAnd there came out of sanctuary a\\nwoman whose name was Almitra. And she\\nwas seeress.\\n\\nAnd he looked upon her with exceeding\\ntenderness, for it was she who had first\\nsought believed in him when he had\\nbeen but day in their city. {14}And\\nshe hailed him, saying:\\n\\nProphet of God, in quest of the\\nuttermost, long have you searched the\\ndistances for your ship.\\n\\nAnd now your ship has come, you must\\nneeds go.\\n\\nDeep is your longing for land of\\nyour memories dwelling place\\nof your greater desires; our love\\nwould not bind you nor our needs hold\\nyou.\\n\\nYet this we ask ere you leave us, that\\nyou speak to us give us of your\\ntruth.\\n\\nAnd we will give it unto our children,\\nand they unto their children, it\\nshall not perish.\\n\\nIn your aloneness you have watched with\\nour days, in your wakefulness you\\nhave listened to weeping the\\nlaughter of our sleep.\\n\\nNow therefore disclose us to ourselves,\\nand tell us all that has been shown\\nyou of that which is between birth and\\ndeath.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd he answered,\\n\\nPeople of Orphalese, of what can I\\n{15}speak save of that which is even now\\nmoving within your souls?\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\nThen said Almitra, Speak to us of\\n_Love_.\\n\\nAnd he raised his head looked upon\\nthe people, there fell stillness\\nupon them. And with great voice he\\nsaid:\\n\\nWhen love beckons to you, follow him,\\n\\nThough his ways are hard steep.\\n\\nAnd when his wings enfold you yield to\\nhim,\\n\\nThough sword hidden among his\\npinions may wound you.\\n\\nAnd when he speaks to you believe in\\nhim,\\n\\nThough his voice may shatter your dreams\\nas north wind lays waste garden.\\n\\nFor even as love crowns you so shall\\nhe crucify you. Even as he is for your\\ngrowth so is he for your pruning.\\n\\nEven as he ascends to your height and\\n{16}caresses your tenderest branches\\nthat quiver in sun,\\n\\nSo shall he descend to your roots and\\nshake them in their clinging to the\\nearth.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nLike sheaves of corn he gathers you unto\\nhimself.\\n\\nHe threshes you to make you naked.\\n\\nHe sifts you to free you from your\\nhusks.\\n\\nHe grinds you to whiteness.\\n\\nHe kneads you until you are pliant;\\n\\nAnd then he assigns you to his sacred\\nfire, that you may become sacred bread\\nfor God’s sacred feast.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAll these things shall love do unto you\\nthat you may know secrets of your\\nheart, in that knowledge become a\\nfragment of Life’s heart.\\n\\nBut if in your fear you would seek only\\nlove’s peace love’s pleasure,\\n\\nThen it is better for you that you\\ncover {17}your nakedness pass out of\\nlove’s threshing-floor,\\n\\nInto seasonless world where you\\nshall laugh, but not all of your\\nlaughter, weep, but not all of your\\ntears.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nLove gives naught but itself takes\\nnaught but from itself.\\n\\nLove possesses not nor would it be\\npossessed;\\n\\nFor love is sufficient unto love.\\n\\nWhen you love you should not say, “God\\nis in my heart,” but rather, “I am in\\nthe heart of God.”\\n\\nAnd think not you can direct course\\nof love, for love, if it finds you\\nworthy, directs your course.\\n\\nLove has no other desire but to fulfil\\nitself.\\n\\nBut if you love must needs have\\ndesires, let these be your desires:\\n\\nTo melt be like running brook that\\nsings its melody to night. {18}To\\nknow pain of too much tenderness.\\n\\nTo be wounded by your own understanding\\nof love;\\n\\nAnd to bleed willingly joyfully.\\n\\nTo wake at dawn with winged heart and\\ngive thanks for another day of loving;\\n\\nTo rest at noon hour meditate\\nlove’s ecstacy;\\n\\nTo return home at eventide with\\ngratitude;\\n\\nAnd then to sleep with prayer for\\nthe beloved in your heart song of\\npraise upon your lips.\\n\\n[Illustration: 0029]\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{19}Then Almitra spoke again said,\\nAnd what of _Marriage_ master?\\n\\nAnd he answered saying:\\n\\nYou were born together, together you\\nshall be forevermore.\\n\\nYou shall be together when white\\nwings of death scatter your days.\\n\\nAye, you shall be together even in the\\nsilent memory of God.\\n\\nBut let there be spaces in your\\ntogetherness,\\n\\nAnd let winds of heavens dance\\nbetween you.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nLove one another, but make not bond of\\nlove:\\n\\nLet it rather be moving sea between\\nthe shores of your souls.\\n\\nFill each other’s cup but drink not from\\none cup.\\n\\nGive one another of your bread but eat\\nnot from same loaf. {20}Sing and\\ndance together be joyous, but let\\neach one of you be alone,\\n\\nEven as strings of lute are alone\\nthough they quiver with same music.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nGive your hearts, but not into each\\nother’s keeping.\\n\\nFor only hand of Life can contain\\nyour hearts.\\n\\nAnd stand together yet not too near\\ntogether:\\n\\nFor pillars of temple stand\\napart,\\n\\nAnd oak tree cypress grow\\nnot in each other’s shadow.\\n\\n[Illustration: 0032]\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{21}And woman who held babe\\nagainst her bosom said, Speak to us of\\n_Children_.\\n\\nAnd he said:\\n\\nYour children are not your children.\\n\\nThey are sons daughters of\\nLife’s longing for itself.\\n\\nThey come through you but not from you,\\n\\nAnd though they are with you yet they\\nbelong not to you.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nYou may give them your love but not your\\nthoughts,\\n\\nFor they have their own thoughts.\\n\\nYou may house their bodies but not their\\nsouls,\\n\\nFor their souls dwell in house of\\ntomorrow, which you cannot visit, not\\neven in your dreams.\\n\\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek\\nnot to make them like you. {22}For\\nlife goes not backward nor tarries with\\nyesterday.\\n\\nYou are bows from which your\\nchildren as living arrows are sent\\nforth.\\n\\nThe archer sees mark upon path\\nof infinite, He bends you with\\nHis might that His arrows may go swift\\nand far.\\n\\nLet your bending in Archer’s hand be\\nfor gladness;\\n\\nFor even as he loves arrow that\\nflies, so He loves also bow that is\\nstable.\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{23}Then said rich man, Speak to us of\\n_Giving_.\\n\\nAnd he answered:\\n\\nYou give but little when you give of\\nyour possessions.\\n\\nIt is when you give of yourself that you\\ntruly give.\\n\\nFor what are your possessions but things\\nyou keep guard for fear you may need\\nthem tomorrow?\\n\\nAnd tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring\\nto overprudent dog burying bones\\nin trackless sand as he follows the\\npilgrims to holy city?\\n\\nAnd what is fear of need but need\\nitself?\\n\\nIs not dread of thirst when your well is\\nfull, thirst that is unquenchable?\\n\\nThere are those who give little of the\\n{24}much which they have--and they give\\nit for recognition their hidden\\ndesire makes their gifts unwholesome.\\n\\nAnd there are those who have little and\\ngive it all.\\n\\nThese are believers in life and\\nthe bounty of life, their coffer is\\nnever empty.\\n\\nThere are those who give with joy, and\\nthat joy is their reward.\\n\\nAnd there are those who give with pain,\\nand that pain is their baptism.\\n\\nAnd there are those who give know\\nnot pain in giving, nor do they seek\\njoy, nor give with mindfulness of\\nvirtue;\\n\\nThey give as in yonder valley myrtle\\nbreathes its fragrance into space.\\n\\nThrough hands of such as these God\\nspeaks, from behind their eyes He\\nsmiles upon earth.\\n\\n[Illustration: 0039]\\n\\nIt is well to give when asked, but it\\nis better to give unasked, through\\nunderstanding;\\n\\nAnd to open-handed search for\\n{25}one who shall receive is joy greater\\nthan giving.\\n\\nAnd is there aught you would withhold?\\n\\nAll you have shall some day be given;\\n\\nTherefore give now, that season\\nof giving may be yours not your\\ninheritors’.\\n\\nYou often say, “I would give, but only\\nto deserving.”\\n\\nThe trees in your orchard say not so,\\nnor flocks in your pasture.\\n\\nThey give that they may live, for to\\nwithhold is to perish.\\n\\nSurely he who is worthy to receive his\\ndays his nights, is worthy of all\\nelse from you.\\n\\nAnd he who has deserved to drink from\\nthe ocean of life deserves to fill his\\ncup from your little stream.\\n\\nAnd what desert greater shall there be,\\nthan that which lies in courage\\nand confidence, nay charity, of\\nreceiving?\\n\\nAnd who are you that men should rend\\n{26}their bosom unveil their pride,\\nthat you may see their worth naked and\\ntheir pride unabashed?\\n\\nSee first that you yourself deserve to\\nbe giver, instrument of giving.\\n\\nFor in truth it is life that gives unto\\nlife--while you, who deem yourself a\\ngiver, are but witness.\\n\\nAnd you receivers--and you are\\nall receivers--assume no weight of\\ngratitude, lest you lay yoke upon\\nyourself upon him who gives.\\n\\nRather rise together with giver on\\nhis gifts as on wings;\\n\\nFor to be overmindful of your debt, is\\nito doubt his generosity who has the\\nfreehearted earth for mother, God\\nfor father.\\n\\n[Illustration: 0042]\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{27}Then old man, keeper of an\\ninn, said, Speak to us of _Eating and\\nDrinking_.\\n\\nAnd he said:\\n\\nWould that you could live on the\\nfragrance of earth, like air\\nplant be sustained by light.\\n\\nBut since you must kill to eat, rob\\nthe newly born of its mother’s milk to\\nquench your thirst, let it then be an\\nact of worship,\\n\\nAnd let your board stand altar on\\nwhich pure innocent of\\nforest plain are sacrificed for that\\nwhich is purer still more innocent\\nin man.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nWhen you kill beast say to him in your\\nheart,\\n\\n“By same power that slays you, I too\\nam slain; I too shall be consumed.\\n{28}For law that delivered you into\\nmy hand shall deliver me into mightier\\nhand.\\n\\nYour blood my blood is naught but\\nthe sap that feeds tree of heaven.”\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd when you crush apple with your\\nteeth, say to it in your heart,\\n\\n“Your seeds shall live in my body,\\n\\nAnd buds of your tomorrow shall\\nblossom in my heart,\\n\\nAnd your fragrance shall be my breath,\\nAnd together we shall rejoice through\\nall seasons.”\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd in autumn, when you gather\\nthe grapes of your vineyards for the\\nwinepress, say in your heart,\\n\\n“I too am vineyard, my fruit shall\\nbe gathered for winepress,\\n\\nAnd like new wine I shall be kept in\\neternal vessels.”\\n\\nAnd in winter, when you draw wine,\\n{29}let there be in your heart song\\nfor each cup;\\n\\nAnd let there be in song a\\nremembrance for autumn days, for\\nthe vineyard, for winepress.\\n\\n*****\\n*****\\n\\n{30} Then ploughman said, Speak\\nto us of _Work_.\\n\\nAnd he answered, saying:\\n\\nYou work that you may keep pace with the\\nearth soul of earth.\\n\\nFor to be idle is to become stranger\\nunto seasons, to step out of\\nlife’s procession, that marches in\\nmajesty proud submission towards the\\ninfinite.\\n\\nWhen you work you are flute through\\nwhose heart whispering of hours\\nturns to music.\\n\\nWhich of you would be reed, dumb and\\nsilent, when all else sings together in\\nunison?\\n\\nAlways you have been told that work is a\\ncurse labour misfortune.\\n\\nBut I say to you that when you work you\\nfulfil part of earth’s furthest dream,\\n{31}assigned to you when that dream was\\nborn,\\n\\nAnd in keeping yourself with labour you\\nare in truth loving life,\\n\\nAnd to love life through labour is to be\\nintimate with life’s inmost secret.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBut if you in your pain call birth an\\naffliction support of flesh\\na curse written upon your brow, then I\\nanswer that naught but sweat of\\nyour brow shall wash away that which is\\nwritten.\\n\\nYou have been told also that life is\\ndarkness, in your weariness you echo\\nwhat was said by weary.\\n\\nAnd I say that life is indeed darkness\\n‘save when there is urge,\\n\\nAnd all urge is blind save when there is\\nknowledge,\\n\\nAnd all knowledge is vain save when\\nthere is work,\\n\\nAnd all work is empty save when there is\\nlove;\\n\\nAnd when you work with love you bind\\n{32}yourself to yourself, to one\\nanother, to God.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd what is it to work with love?\\n\\nIt is to weave cloth with threads\\ndrawn from your heart, even as if your\\nbeloved were to wear that cloth.\\n\\nIt is to build house with affection,\\neven as if your beloved were to dwell in\\nthat house.\\n\\nIt is to sow seeds with tenderness and\\nreap harvest with joy, even as if\\nyour beloved were to eat fruit.\\n\\nIt is to charge all things you fashion\\nwith breath of your own spirit,\\n\\nAnd to know that all blessed dead\\nare standing about you watching.\\n\\nOften have I heard you say, as if\\nspeaking in sleep, “He who works in\\nmarble, finds shape of his own\\nsoul in stone, is nobler than he who\\nploughs soil. {33}And he who seizes\\nthe rainbow to lay it on cloth in the\\nlikeness of man, is more than he who\\nmakes sandals for our feet.”\\n\\nBut I say, not in sleep but in the\\noverwakefulness of noontide, that the\\nwind speaks not more sweetly to the\\ngiant oaks than to least of all the\\nblades of grass;\\n\\nAnd he alone is great who turns the\\nvoice of wind into song made\\nsweeter by his own loving.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nWork is love made visible.\\n\\nAnd if you cannot work with love but\\nonly with distaste, it is better that\\nyou should leave your work sit at\\nthe gate of temple take alms of\\nthose who work with joy.\\n\\nFor if you bake bread with indifference,\\nyou bake bitter bread that feeds but\\nhalf man’s hunger.\\n\\nAnd if you grudge crushing of the\\ngrapes, your grudge distils poison in\\nthe wine. {34}And if you sing though as\\nangels, love not singing, you\\nmuffle man’s ears to voices of the\\nday voices of night.\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{35}Then woman said, Speak to us of\\n_Joy Sorrow_.\\n\\nAnd he answered:\\n\\nYour joy is your sorrow unmasked.\\n\\nAnd selfsame well from which your\\nlaughter rises was oftentimes filled\\nwith your tears.\\n\\nAnd how else can it be?\\n\\nThe deeper that sorrow carves into your\\nbeing, more joy you can contain.\\n\\nIs not cup that holds your wine the\\nvery cup that was burned in potter’s\\noven?\\n\\nAnd is not lute that soothes your\\nspirit, very wood that was hollowed\\nwith knives?\\n\\nWhen you are joyous, look deep into your\\nheart you shall find it is only\\nthat which has given you sorrow that is\\ngiving you joy.\\n\\nWhen you are sorrowful look again in\\n{36}your heart, you shall see that\\nin truth you are weeping for that which\\nhas been your delight.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nSome of you say, “Joy is greater than\\nsorrow,” others say, “Nay, sorrow is\\nthe greater.”\\n\\nBut I say unto you, they are\\ninseparable.\\n\\nTogether they come, when one sits\\nalone with you at your board, remember\\nthat other is asleep upon your bed.\\n\\nVerily you are suspended like scales\\nbetween your sorrow your joy.\\n\\nOnly when you are empty are you at\\nstandstill balanced.\\n\\nWhen treasure-keeper lifts you to\\nweigh his gold his silver, needs\\nmust your joy or your sorrow rise or\\nfall.\\n\\n***** *****\\n\\n{37}Then mason came forth said,\\nSpeak to us of _Houses_.\\n\\nAnd he answered said:\\n\\nBuild of your imaginings bower in the\\nwilderness ere you build house within\\nthe city walls.\\n\\nFor even as you have home-comings in\\nyour twilight, so has wanderer in\\nyou, ever distant alone.\\n\\nYour house is your larger body.\\n\\nIt grows in sun sleeps in the\\nstillness of night; it is not\\ndreamless. Does not your house dream?\\nand dreaming, leave city for grove\\nor hilltop?\\n\\nWould that I could gather your houses\\ninto my hand, like sower scatter\\nthem in forest meadow.\\n\\nWould valleys were your streets, and\\nthe green paths your alleys, that you\\n{38}might seek one another through\\nvineyards, come with fragrance\\nof earth in your garments.\\n\\nBut these things are not yet to be.\\n\\nIn their fear your forefathers gathered\\nyou too near together.

you beauty, that leads heart\\nfrom things fashioned of wood stone\\nto holy mountain?\\n\\nTell me, have you these in your houses?\\n\\nOr have you only comfort, lust\\nfor comfort, that stealthy thing that\\n{39}enters house guest, then\\nbecomes host, then master?\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAy, it becomes tamer, with\\nhook scourge makes puppets of your\\nlarger desires.\\n\\nThough its hands are silken, its heart\\nis of iron.\\n\\nIt lulls you to sleep only to stand by\\nyour bed jeer at dignity of the\\nflesh.\\n\\nIt makes mock of your sound senses, and\\nlays them in thistledown like fragile\\nvessels.\\n\\nVerily lust for comfort murders\\nthe passion of soul, then walks\\ngrinning in funeral.\\n\\nBut you, children of space, you restless\\nin rest, you shall not be trapped nor\\ntamed.\\n\\nYour house shall be not anchor but a\\nmast.\\n\\nIt shall not be glistening film that\\n{40}covers wound, but eyelid that\\nguards eye.\\n\\nYou shall not fold your wings that you\\nmay pass through doors, nor bend your\\nheads that they strike not against a\\nceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls\\nshould crack fall down.\\n\\nYou shall not dwell in tombs made by the\\ndead for living.\\n\\nAnd though of magnificence and\\nsplendour, your house shall not hold\\nyour secret nor shelter your longing.\\n\\nFor that which is boundless in you\\nabides in mansion of

{58}For reason, ruling alone,\\nis force confining; passion,\\nunattended, is flame that burns to its\\nown destruction.\\n\\nTherefore let your soul exalt your\\nreason to height of passion, that

in\\nsilence, “God rests in reason.”\\n\\nAnd when storm comes, the\\n{59}mighty wind shakes forest,\\nand thunder lightning proclaim the\\nmajesty of sky,--then let your heart\\nsay in awe, “God

without words, in friendship, all\\nthoughts, all desires, all expectations\\nare born shared, with joy that is\\nunacclaimed.\\n\\nWhen you part from your friend, you\\ngrieve not;\\n\\nFor that which you love most in him\\nmay be clearer in his absence, as the\\nmountain to climber is clearer\\nfrom plain. {67}And let there be no\\npurpose in friendship save deepening\\nof spirit.\\n\\nFor

make merry without\\nknowing.\\n\\nOthers have come to you to whom for\\ngolden promises made unto your faith\\nyou have given but riches power and\\nglory.\\n\\nLess than promise have I given, and\\nyet more generous have you been to me.\\n\\nYou have given me my deeper thirsting\\nafter life.\\n\\nSurely there is no greater gift to man\\nthan that which turns all his aims\\ninto parching lips all life into a\\nfountain.\\n\\n[Illustration: 0125]\\n\\n{99}And in this lies my honour my\\nreward,--\\n\\nThat whenever I come to fountain\\nto drink I find living water

was it not your loving mindfulness\\nof my days my nights that made food\\nsweet to my mouth girdled my sleep\\nwith visions?\\n\\nFor this I bless you most:\\n\\nYou give much know not that you

you have called me aloof,\\nand drunk with my own aloneness,\\n\\nAnd you have said, “He holds council\\nwith trees of forest, but not\\nwith men.\\n\\nHe sits alone on hill-tops looks\\ndown upon our city.”\\n\\nTrue it is that I have climbed hills\\nand walked in remote places.\\n\\nHow could I have seen you save from a\\ngreat height or great distance?\\n\\nHow can one be indeed near unless he be\\ntar?\\n\\nAnd others among you called unto me, not\\nin words, they said,\\n\\n“Stranger, stranger, lover of\\nunreachable heights, why dwell you among\\nthe summits where eagles build\\ntheir nests? {101}Why seek you the\\nunattainable?\\n\\nWhat storms would you trap in your net,\\n\\nAnd what vaporous birds do you hunt in\\nthe sky?\\n\\nCome be one of us.\\n\\nDescend appease your hunger with our\\nbread quench your thirst with our\\nwine.”\\n\\nIn solitude of their souls they said\\nthese things;\\n\\nBut were their solitude deeper they\\nwould have known that I sought but the\\nsecret of your joy your pain,\\n\\nAnd I hunted only your larger selves\\nthat walk sky.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBut hunter was also hunted;\\n\\nFor many of my arrows left my bow only\\nto seek my own breast.\\n\\nAnd flier was also creeper;\\n\\nFor when my wings were spread in the\\nsun their shadow upon earth was a\\nturtle.\\n\\nAnd I believer was also doubter;\\n{102}For often have I put my finger\\nin my own wound that I might have the\\ngreater belief in you greater\\nknowledge of you.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd it is with this belief this\\nknowledge that I say,\\n\\nYou are not enclosed within your bodies,\\nnor confined to houses or fields.\\n\\nThat which is you dwells above the\\nmountain roves with wind.\\n\\nIt is not thing that crawls into\\nthe sun for warmth or digs holes into\\ndarkness for safety,\\n\\nBut thing free, spirit that envelops\\nthe earth moves in ether.\\n\\nIf these be vague words, then seek not\\nto clear them.\\n\\nVague nebulous is beginning of\\nall things, but not their end,\\n\\nAnd I fain would have you remember me as\\na beginning.\\n\\nLife, all that lives, is conceived\\nin mist not in crystal.\\n{103}And who knows but crystal is mist\\nin decay?\\n\\n*****\\n\\nThis would I have you remember in\\nremembering me:\\n\\nThat which seems most feeble and\\nbewildered in you is strongest and\\nmost determined.\\n\\nIs it not your breath that has erected\\nand hardened structure of your\\nbones?\\n\\nAnd is it not dream which none of you\\nremember having dreamt, that builded\\nyour city fashioned all there is in\\nit?\\n\\nCould you but see tides of that\\nbreath you would cease to see all else,\\n\\nAnd if you could hear whispering of\\nthe dream you would hear no other sound.\\n\\nBut you do not see, nor do you hear, and\\nit is well.\\n\\nThe veil that clouds your eyes shall be\\nlifted by hands that wove it,\\n\\nAnd clay that fills your ears shall\\nbe pierced by those fingers that kneaded\\nit. {104}And you shall see.\\n\\nAnd you shall hear.\\n\\nYet you shall not deplore having known\\nblindness, nor regret having been deaf.\\n\\nFor in that day you shall know the\\nhidden purposes in all things,\\n\\nAnd you shall bless darkness as you\\nwould bless light.\\n\\nAfter saying these things he looked\\nabout him, he saw pilot of his\\nship standing by helm gazing\\nnow at full sails now at the\\ndistance.\\n\\nAnd he said:\\n\\nPatient, over patient, is captain of\\nmy ship.\\n\\nThe wind blows, restless are the\\nsails;\\n\\nEven rudder begs direction;\\n\\nYet quietly my captain awaits my\\nsilence.\\n\\nAnd these my mariners, who have heard\\nthe choir of greater sea, they too\\nhave heard me patiently. {105}Now they\\nshall wait no longer.\\n\\nI am ready.\\n\\nThe stream has reached sea, and\\nonce more great mother holds her son\\nagainst her breast.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nFare you well, people of Orphalese.\\n\\nThis day has ended.\\n\\nIt is closing upon us even as the\\nwater-lily upon its own tomorrow.\\n\\nWhat was given us here we shall keep,\\n\\nAnd if it suffices not, then again must\\nwe come together together stretch\\nour hands unto giver.\\n\\nForget not that I shall come back to\\nyou.\\n\\nA little while, my longing shall\\ngather dust foam for another body.\\n\\nA little while, moment of rest upon\\nthe wind, another woman shall bear\\nme.\\n\\nFarewell to you youth I have\\nspent with you.\\n\\nIt was but yesterday we met in a\\ndream. {106}You have sung to me in my\\naloneness, I of your longings have\\nbuilt tower in sky.\\n\\nBut now our sleep has fled our dream\\nis over, it is no longer dawn.\\n\\nThe noontide is upon us our half\\nwaking has turned to fuller day, we\\nmust part.\\n\\nIf in twilight of memory we should\\nmeet once more, we shall speak again\\ntogether you shall sing to me a\\ndeeper song.\\n\\nAnd if our hands should meet in another\\ndream we shall build another tower in\\nthe sky.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nSo saying he made signal to the\\nseamen, straightway they weighed\\nanchor cast ship loose from its\\nmoorings, they moved eastward.\\n\\nAnd cry came from people as from a\\nsingle heart, it rose into dusk\\nand was carried out over sea like a\\ngreat trumpeting.\\n\\nOnly Almitra was silent, gazing after\\n{107}the ship until it had vanished into\\nthe mist.\\n\\nAnd when all people were dispersed\\nshe still stood alone upon sea-wall,\\nremembering in her heart his saying,\\n\\n“A little while, moment of rest upon\\nthe wind, another woman shall
